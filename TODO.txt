TODO list:

1. Showing all my flashcards on front page in the GUI
2. writing tests for all classes in org.linden package
3. Adding endpoints for creating a specific flashcard exercise, i.e a collection of flashcards that can be practised
separately


Ideas for stuff to do in the future
* Notify user via mail that it is time to practice again
    - notification should include link directly to web page
    - notification should include link a list of words that needs be practiced according to some algorithm.
* Adding easy set-up for friend to start using application.
* Adding terraform code for deployment in AWS.
